# ====== üêß Penguin Species Classification üêß ======

## Description

Here four supervised machine learning algorithms are used to prediction for a multiclass classification dataset. This project showcases a simple implementation, tuning, and comparison of Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

This project includes a few data pre-processing such as label encoding and data normalization by scaling. Afterward, the hyperparameters are tuned and trained on the training dataset for all 4 algorithms and then predictions are made on the cross-validation and test set. These algorithms are compared based on their accuracy and each class's F1 scores.

The Decision Tree algorithm is able to achieve **100 % accuracy** with the right values for the hyperparameters.

They can be classified based on different features like the island, sex, body mass, flipper length, bill length & bill depth.
